# The dynamics of diversity and abundance of symbionts in the metatranscriptome

## Goal:

The goal of this project is the description of the symbiont composition associated with Eulimnogammarus verrucosus

## Objectives:

-- Choose the optimal method for characterizing the symbiont composition
-- Characterize the samples (diversity and abundance of symbionts) by the selected method
-- Characterize the variability of these parameters from sample to sample
