# The dynamics of diversity and abundance of symbionts in the metatranscriptome

## Goal:

The goal of this project is the description of the symbiont composition associated with Eulimnogammarus verrucosus

## Objectives:

\begin{item}

\item Choose the optimal method for characterizing the symbiont composition
\item Characterize the samples (diversity and abundance of symbionts) by the selected method
\item Characterize the variability of these parameters from sample to sample

\end{item}
